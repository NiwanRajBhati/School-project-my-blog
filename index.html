                 The park is named after the historic Ranthambore Fort, which is situated within its boundaries.
                
                 Ranthambore is a home to many animals like deer, monkeys, and various bird species.
                
                 The park has lush green forests and rocky hills, providing a perfect habitat for wildlife.
